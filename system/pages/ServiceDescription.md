## About the SharePoint PnP Provisioning Service

The SharePoint PnP Provisioning Service lets you add samples, templates and solutions to your Office 365 tenant.

The service provisions content and configuration for site collections, sites, and tenants as documented in each sample, template and solution. We strongly recommend deploying to a test tenant so that you can carefully analyze the results before deploying to your production tenant.

This is an open source community hosted service, so there is no support from Microsoft for this service or for the contents of samples, templates, and solutions.
