## Service Description

Setup quick demo environments to your test tenants! This service is currently available for **preview** cross the world for any tenant. You can use this service (when released) to provision different kind of sites and site collections to your tenant. We do recommend using these templates first in your test tenant or carefully analyze what the template contains before installing anything into your production tenant to avoid unexpected changes as some configurations are applied in the tenant scope. This is an open-source community hosted service, so there's no specific support channel from Microsoft for this service.
