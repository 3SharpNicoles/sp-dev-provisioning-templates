# Privacy & Cookies

This service does not collect or store any data related on the users or tenans where it has been used. When provisioning happens, you are required to consent the application with the needed permissions. Those permissions are then used to provisioning the selected template to your tenant. Service does not store this access for later.

If you provided additional email for getting notified when the provisioning is completed, this information is used to send an email after the template provisionign is completeled. Provided email is not stored for later usage. Service is not tracking any user or tenant specific information.

Service has been published as a multi-tenant application in Azure Active Directory and by granting the needed permissions, that application will get registered as approved application in your tenant. This is standard multi-tenant operation, which is needed for the services to be able to perform needed operations during provisioning operation. You can delete the "" application from your Azure Active Diretory after you have provisioned selected templates. This would not impact anything what has been already provisioned.
