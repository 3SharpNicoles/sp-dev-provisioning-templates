# Provisioning

Following options are the setting exposed from the selected template. You can override them, if needed, or use the default settings. You can also optionally define a custom theme to be automatically created as part of the provisioning. You can use the [Theme Generator](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/themegenerator) tool for getting the needed values. Notice that this custom theme will be created as a tenant level theme and then automatically applied on the site collections created using this tool.
