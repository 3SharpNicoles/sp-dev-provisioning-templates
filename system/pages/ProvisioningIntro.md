# Provisioning

Following options are the setting exposed from the selected template. You can override them, if needed, or use the default settings. You can also optionally chose to use existing custom theme from your tenant. If you want site to use existing theme aligned with intended branding, we recommend that you first deploy the custom theme to the target tenant and then select it to be used in this UI. Alternatively you can control theme and other branding settings after the site has been provisioned.
