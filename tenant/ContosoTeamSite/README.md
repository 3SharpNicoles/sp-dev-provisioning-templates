# Contoso Team Site

This template is quite complex template with some example content for enabling collaboration in team site level.

Notice that you can easily extend the initially provisioned site for example by doing following modifications:

- Include product or company news directly on the team site welcome page from the hub sites
- Include discussions and other web parts on the page based on your requirements
