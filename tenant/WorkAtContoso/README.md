Work @ Contoso template consists from multiple site collections which are all automatically associated on the hub site, so that all out-of-the-box aggregation capabiilties will work as expected.

Template also creates the hub navigation automatically with a sample information architecture, which you can easily modify and extend based on your own requirements.
